🔎 **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects
as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use
the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running app

Если нет [Nx](https://nx.dev) - поставить его

А дальше по стандарту `npm install` -> `npm start` | `nx start`
